## 1. About 
This small snippets allows you to track a users WhatsApp behavior exploiting the WhatsApp web implementation. It monitors the users online-offline activity. At the moment it is only possible to monitor one user at the same time. The collected material is stored in a CSV file on your tracking machine.

### IMPORTANT NOTE
Code is still under developement and needs a lot improvement. It is meant as a personal PoC, but maybe some of will find it useful. If you have any questions, sugesstions or see bugs just let me know.

## 2. Requirements
* Smartphone and phone number where WhatsApp is installed and registred
* A browser on a Windows/Linux/Mac machine which is connected to the SmartPhone using WhatsApp web (tested on Chrome)
* The Smartphone and tracking machine (WhatsApp web) needs to be online 24/7 to ensure that a full time monitoring of the user is achived
* Python 3 installed on you tracking machine
* RECOMMENDED: It is recommended to use a dedicated phone number which only uses WhatsApp for tracking purpose. If you use your private WhatsApp installation, your normal chatting behaviour may interfere with the tracking script. It does not mean that it will not work with multiple active chats in WhatsApp web. It just means that I cannot guarantuee that it always works with an actively used WhatsApp instance. However, I tested it in both scenarios and had no problems.

## 3. Usage
1. Set permissions for the CGI Python 3 server: `chmod a+x cgi-bin/exfil.py`
2. Set writeable permissions for `data.csv`
3. Start the CGI Server: `python3 server.py`
4. Open WhatsApp web and select the user to track. If you have multiple chats in WhatsApp you should pin the user you want to track. This means the user will always be at the top and guarantees that the tracking script works properly.
5. Open the web developer console
6. Insert the JavaScript code available inside the file `inject.js`
7. (Sometimes the status "last seen" magically disappears even if the user does not have strict privacy settings. If that is the case just click again on the user in the left menu and the status is back)
8. Wait for data added to `data.csv` as soon as the user is online
9. Analyse the data collected in `data.csv`

## 4. Reports
1. Switch to the folder `reporting`
2. Execute `python3 reportserver.py` - This script performs the following actions:
* Starting a reporting web server on port `81`
* Generating and updating a HTML file for the target every 60 seconds

Access your browser on http://localhost:81 to view the report.

## 5. Example
Output may differ from screenshots in newer versions.
